# NHANES Capstone Project 1 (NumPy Matrices)

## Overview
This project analyses adult body measurement data from the NHANES dataset for male and female participants.
The analysis is performed using NumPy matrices and Matplotlib visualisations.

## Dataset
The following files were used:
- nhanes_adult_male_bmx_2020.csv
- nhanes_adult_female_bmx_2020.csv

Each dataset contains 7 measurement columns:
1. Weight (kg)
2. Standing height (cm)
3. Upper arm length (cm)
4. Upper leg length (cm)
5. Arm circumference (cm)
6. Hip circumference (cm)
7. Waist circumference (cm)

## Tasks Performed
- Loaded NHANES data as NumPy matrices
- Plotted histograms of female and male weight distributions
- Compared weights using box-and-whisker plots
- Computed numerical summaries (mean, median, dispersion, skewness)
- Computed BMI for female participants and added it as an additional column
- Standardised the female dataset using z-scores
- Created a scatterplot matrix and computed Pearson and Spearman correlations
- Computed waist-to-height and waist-to-hip ratios for both groups
- Compared ratio distributions using boxplots
- Analysed participants with the lowest and highest BMI values

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
